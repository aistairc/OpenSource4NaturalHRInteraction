Open Source System Integration Towards Natural Interaction with Robots

This is a public repository which contains an open source robot interaction architecture to enable natural interacton with a reobot agent. The system is built on a ROS platform and it integrates ESPNet speech recognizer (Watanabe et al. 2018 https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00015), Rasa dialogue model (https://rasa.com/) and Nao Robot (https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/nao)

The work is done by Ayaka Fujii as Research Assistant at AIST AI Research Center, under the supervision of Kristiina Jokinen.
